## Tips for Working with AI Agents

✅ **Be specific:** "Create an Express route handler" vs "I need some backend code"

✅ **Provide context:** Include tech stack, requirements, constraints

✅ **Break down tasks:** "Create the entire app" → "Create webhook receiver" → "Add queue system" → etc.

✅ **Share error messages:** Full stack traces help AI debug faster

✅ **Iterate:** First draft might not be perfect - refine with follow-ups

✅ **Test immediately:** Don't accumulate untested AI-generated code

❌ **Don't blindly copy-paste:** Understand what the code does

❌ **Don't skip testing:** AI can't test in your environment

❌ **Don't assume AI knows your business logic:** Explain your specific needs

---

## Recommended Workflow

```
1. Architecture Advisor → Plan the system
2. Code Generator → Build feature
3. Testing Strategist → Write tests
4. Debugger → Fix issues
5. Security Auditor → Review security
6. Documentation Writer → Document it
7. DevOps Engineer → Deploy it
8. Performance Optimizer → Optimize later
```

For each feature, cycle through relevant agents. Don't try to do everything at once.

## Agent Prompt Library Location

Save your refined prompts as you develop them:
- `/prompts/architecture/`
- `/prompts/code-gen/`
- `/prompts/debugging/`
- etc.

This way you can reuse successful prompts and build your own "AI team" over time.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Agent 1 (Architecture Advisor)** to validate your tech stack choices
2. **Move to Agent 2 (Code Generator)** to build your first endpoint (webhook receiver)
3. **Keep Agent 3 (Debugger)** ready for when things break
4. **Consult Agent 4 (Integration Specialist)** when connecting to Shopify/Meta

Good luck building! 🚀
